# Engineering-White-Lamp-Task
I chose to create a programme to analyze the 3 biggest DAO's.

Before making this programme I had zero experience in web scraping. I spent the first 45 minutes learning the in's and out's but 45 minutes is not enough to master the whole thing. I managed to put together something that sort of works but it lacks alot of information.

Language used is Python and libraries used are BeautifulSoup and requests. Currently the programme only obtains the name, the price, and the market cap of the top 3 DAO's. It does not go through the rankings of DAO's, rather, you have to manually input the URL in the code. It will only work if the URL is from 'https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies'.

Other than learning web scraping, a big chunk of my time was spent looking for a website that is easily scrapable. Due to my inexperience, I could not deal with scraping div's with no class or id, or multiple div's with the same class or id. I did not know how to sort through them. Perhaps if I had more time learning then maybe I would have figured it out.
